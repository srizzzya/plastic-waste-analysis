**Plastic Waste Around the World — Data Analysis & Visualization**

What happens to the plastic after you throw it away — and who really pays the price?

This is my **first independent data project**, where I combined datasets, cleaned messy data, analyzed global trends, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover hidden insights around global plastic waste and recycling.

## Project Goals

I set out to explore questions like:

- Which countries generate the most plastic waste?
- Is recycling really working — or is it a myth?
- Does GDP affect waste production or recycling?
- Which continents are most at risk due to coastal waste?

## Visualizations Created

Built using **Power BI**, after preprocessing and analysis with **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**

-  **Pie Chart** – Total Plastic Waste by Country
-  **Bar Chart** – Per Capita Waste
-  **Stacked Chart** – GDP by Continent
-  **Filled Map** – Continent-wise Waste vs Recycling
-  **Line Graph** – Coastal Risk by Country
-  **Donut Chart** – Share of Global Waste by Continent
