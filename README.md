# **Plastic Waste Around the World — Data Analysis & Visualization**

What happens to the plastic after you throw it away — and who really pays the price?

This is my **first independent data project**, where I combined datasets, cleaned messy data, analyzed global trends, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover hidden insights around global plastic waste and recycling.

---

## Project Goals

I set out to explore questions like:

- Which countries generate the most plastic waste?
- Is recycling really working — or is it a myth?
- Does GDP affect waste production or recycling?
- Which continents are most at risk due to coastal waste?

## Visualizations Created

Built using **Power BI**, after preprocessing and analysis with **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**

-  **Pie Chart** – Total Plastic Waste by Country
-  **Bar Chart** – Per Capita Waste
-  **Stacked Chart** – GDP by Continent
-  **Filled Map** – Continent-wise Waste vs Recycling
-  **Line Graph** – Coastal Risk by Country
-  **Donut Chart** – Share of Global Waste by Continent

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Excel (initial exploration)

# Key Insights

Plastic Waste is Unequally DistributedCountries like China and the US dominate total waste, but smaller countries are just as alarming per capita.

High GDP ≠ High RecyclingWealth doesn’t guarantee responsible recycling. There's a noticeable gap between what’s claimed and what’s recycled.

Coastal Risk is RisingSeveral nations face high risk due to poor coastal waste management infrastructure.

Recycling Might Be a MythEven top recyclers fall short when compared to the sheer volume they generate.

# Challenges Faced

- Cleaning mismatched country names across datasets
- Handling missing values in GDP and continent mappings
- Power BI's map visual not loading (resolved via security settings)
- Designing visuals that were both insightful and clear

# Why This Matters

This wasn’t just a dashboard.It was about asking difficult questions, working through messy data, and crafting a story that could make people pause and reflect.
This project made me think:We're finally facing the cost of our actions — and ignoring the data won't help.
